I have some code like this:

```html
<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');
  [your code here]
</script>
```

What code should I use to make a chart which answers this question:

what are the top 7 countries for our subscribers?

Using this data:

c	s
United Kingdom	7058
USA	1049
Germany	320
Brazil	241
Canada	228
Italy	220
Spain	189

Just reply with the code. Don't explain it. Include all the code, including the first <div>.
